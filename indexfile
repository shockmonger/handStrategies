#Index of variables for moco:

s - struct - all mocap data
d - struct = derivates of all mocap data

sh - struct - all mocap data having unequal lengths
newSH - struct - old don't use mocap data with unequal lengths
qom - struct - rowwise sum of sh
newQoM - rowwise sum of newsh
normQoM - mat2gray of newqom

shl.shl1:22 - struct - all mocap data of equal lengths cut from the beginning, absolute value only

win.win1:22.dowsj - stuct - sliding windows of 1:22 samples, dows of number of windows
this is only for rhy

sums.sum1:22 - struct - sums of sliding window rhy qoms
indices.ind1:22 - struct - indices of sums
max_sh1:22 - struct - max n sums from sums1:22
maxindex1:22 - struct - indices of max_sh1:22


#IFCLEAN

shl - equal sized mocap hands 6 colum vectors from 1:22
qom - rowwise sums of each 6 column vector

selectwins1:704 - 
1-704 arrays of 6 column vectors retrieved from top 32 windows from 22 participants

#arrays:
one, two, three, four, five, six - 1-6 features
1-704 1 column vector result for each feature
meansone - six
stdevone - six

plot means of 704 samples in arrays one through six

whether thresholds?

if thresholds, select
#arrays
sone, stwo, sthree, sfour, sfive, ssix
meanssone-six
stdevone-six


#need the following:

#feature list
#1 - QoM(rhy)-QoM(lhy) #minimize this difference for bilateral symmetry
#2 - gradient(LHX)-gradient(RHX^T) #minimize
#3 - RHY-LHY^T  #how to transpose laterally if y axis? means do x axis?
#4 - RH(x,y,z) ~ LH(x,y,z) #difference of qom minimize
#5 - x^2+y^2+z^2 #if fits then more specific
#6 - t(RH(xyz)) - t(LH(xyz)) + C #DTW feature? 

structs
one - six = 1:end of each of these features
