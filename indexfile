#Index of variables for moco:

s - struct - all mocap data
d - struct = derivates of all mocap data

sh - struct - all mocap data having unequal lengths
newSH - struct - old don't use mocap data with unequal lengths
qom - struct - rowwise sum of sh
newQoM - rowwise sum of newsh
normQoM - mat2gray of newqom

shl.shl1:22 - struct - all mocap data of equal lengths cut from the beginning, absolute value only

win.win1:22.dowsj - stuct - sliding windows of 1:22 samples, dows of number of windows
this is only for rhy

sums.sum1:22 - struct - sums of sliding window rhy qoms
indices.ind1:22 - struct - indices of sums
max_sh1:22 - struct - max n sums from sums1:22
maxindex1:22 - struct - indices of max_sh1:22


#IFCLEAN

shl - equal sized mocap hands 6 colum vectors from 1:22
qom - rowwise sums of each 6 column vector
